## About Me - Projects from this year

### Tri 1: P2-Chickens | Fake News Checker
For this project, we created a site where you could input a news source to check its reliability. The site also gave information about which news sources were reliable, and which may contain fake news. You were also able to learn about where different news sources were placed on the political spectrum, spanning from left, center, to right. We created this project with the intent to help educate students/people about how to identify fake news and help them only get true information.

### Tri 2: P1-DataPirates | Movie Talk
This project was created for entertainment instead of educational purposes. Movie Talk is a movie rating site where you could browse and search movies by category. For each movie, you could watch a wide selection of trailers and clips from the movie. Each movie also included a 0.0-10.0 score from TMDB. We also included a featured page that included our hand picked favorites currently in theaters, or movies that we're excited for coming soon. This site was created to easily find good movies without the clutter of modern movie sites.

## Tri 3 Current Project and Technical Plan

This trimester, we are creating a music gacha game. This is a japanese genre of game where you open loot boxes to recieve different music and artists as collectibles. I plan to work on mostly frontend, designing and styling different pages of our site. I also need to make sure that the experience is simple, and easy to navigate. I plan to use HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Java in this project.
